In almost every project there will come a point where you reach for an existing
package to augment your source code to make it simpler, more robust, or to
reduce the amount of maintenance. When you reach for a libary it is important to
evaluate the different options available, on a number of different fronts. If
you simply evaluate a package based on if it will accomplish the task you have
for it, you might miss out on some important considerations that can come back
and hurt you later. For instance, if you pick a package that only has 1 line of
actual source code and no tests does that package really give you any benefits?
I would say it doesn't, but each project is different and it might be helpful to
your project to be able to import that 1 line from a package instead of a local
file.

So, what do you consider when evaluating a package? In my experience, it's
helpful to have a list ready to go through for each package that you think might
work for the need you have. My list usually looks something like the following:

- License permissiveness
- Stability
- Maintenance Level
- Popularity
- Documentation Quality
- Amount of code in the library
- Amount of code it will require/save in my project
- Open and Closed Pull Request trends
- Contributing Documentation

In using this list, I have a number of questions I ask myself to evaluate each
category, which I'll include below. Before that though, I want to point out that
this list is definitely personal opinions that I have found useful in my
projects. If you have other suggestions, feel free to share them with me! I'd
love to know what other people do when evaluating packages, since there might be
critical steps I'm missing.

## License permissiveness

The first point that I usually check when evaluating a potential solution to my
problem is the license that it uses, and how permissive that license is. When
evaluating packages for use in a work project it's super important to follow the
guidelines of your organization, as it can cause some major issues if you use a
license incorrectly. So, the questions that I ask myself regarding the license:

- Is the license on the short-list of pre-approved ones for the organization?
- Is the license something I'm comfortable with using in a personal project?
- Does the license require any sort of attribution or having my project adopt
  that license?
- Is using this package worth the license requirements?

## Stability

## Maintenance Level

## Popularity

## Documentation Quality

## Amount of code in the library

## Amount of code it will require/save in my project

## Open and Closed Pull Request trends

## Contributing Documentation

## Outline / Prep

What matters with a JavaScript Open Source Package? (Not ordered)

TL;DR Points:

- Check the stability and popularity - are there frequent releases? Do people
  use it?
- What's the Maintenance level? Are there people working on it full-time?
- Code/Documentation/Contributing quality - are things documented and working?
- License check is vital! Make sure it is a license you can use
- Consider writing it yourself if it's insignificant?

* Stability (How often do they release? Do they do alpha/beta releases? Do
  people use those?)
* Maintenance level (are people working on it full-time? Does it have multiple
  contributors? etc)
* Popularity (How many other projects depend on it? What do the download counts
  look like?)
* Code Quality (Do they have tests? CI builds?)
* Documentation quality (Is it up to date? Do they have previous versions
  available? Is it a separate site or just a readme?)
* Contributing Documentation (Does it exist? Do they have Issue/PR Templates in
  github?)
* Open and Closed Pull Requests (Did they sit for a long time? Was there
  back-and-forth conversation about them?)
* What license(s) does it have involved in it? (Is it clear why it has those?
  Does your organization allow it?)
* How much code is actually there? (bundlephobia & looking at the source - it
  might be better to inline)
