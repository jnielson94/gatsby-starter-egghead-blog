## Outline / Prep

What matters with a JavaScript Open Source Package? (Not ordered)

TL;DR Points:

- Check the stability and popularity - are there frequent releases? Do people
  use it?
- What's the Maintenance level? Are there people working on it full-time?
- Code/Documentation/Contributing quality - are things documented and working?
- License check is vital! Make sure it is a license you can use
- Consider writing it yourself if it's insignificant?

* Stability (How often do they release? Do they do alpha/beta releases? Do
  people use those?)
* Maintenance level (are people working on it full-time? Does it have multiple
  contributors? etc)
* Popularity (How many other projects depend on it? What do the download counts
  look like?)
* Code Quality (Do they have tests? CI builds?)
* Documentation quality (Is it up to date? Do they have previous versions
  available? Is it a separate site or just a readme?)
* Contributing Documentation (Does it exist? Do they have Issue/PR Templates in
  github?)
* Open and Closed Pull Requests (Did they sit for a long time? Was there
  back-and-forth conversation about them?)
* What license(s) does it have involved in it? (Is it clear why it has those?
  Does your organization allow it?)
* How much code is actually there? (bundlephobia & looking at the source - it
  might be better to inline)
