## The story behind the post

> Feel free to skip this section ðŸ˜ƒ

At work we pretty regularly give training to other developers with a wide range
of experience, one of our offerings being an internal "react bootcamp" that is
presented over the course of a week primarily targeting developers who are new
to react but have experience with JavaScript. As part of preparing for this
trianing I was assigned to add a section that I pointed out we should add-An
Intro to React Hooks. What this section should include was left for me to
determine, and as I searched around for documentation from the react team it
seemed like most of the information targeted people who had experience with
react already. For example, the official docs are focused on people with
experience.

The [Intro to hooks docs page](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) page
states:

> Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React
> features without writing a class.

The [Hooks at a glance](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) page
states:

> This page provides an overview of Hooks for experienced React users. This is a
> fast-paced overview.

To further complicate this section, I don't want to include anything about
`state` since we have an entire section on that (which currently will follow
this one). This section will be after they've already been introduced to the
idea of components and the basics of props... So, the content for this section
will need to be introductory but won't be super detailed. I'm using this post as
a way to write down the ideas that are currently located in my head before
trying to condense them down into a slide format. I personally find it way
easier to create slides from a written post since it helps them to flow and be
more complete ðŸ˜ƒ So, here goes nothing!
