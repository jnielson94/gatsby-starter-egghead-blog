Hi there! I have a newsletter! You can sign up at the bottom of this post, or by
heading over to [the newsletter page](https://jnielson.com/newsletter)!
Though... I don't expect you to sign up right now, since you have no idea why
you'd even do it. Hopefully this post answers some of the questions you might
have about why I have a newsletter, and if you decide to sign up, great. If not,
that's cool too.

## Why A Newsletter?

First things first, I like newsletters. I greatly prefer to receive an email
about something that I think might be important. If someone that I think does
great work has one, I sign up for it. and I have over 20 people I've signed up
to receive newsletters in my personal inbox from! If you have a newsletter,
[add it to this twitter thread!](https://twitter.com/jnielson94/status/1253170994757292033)

Secondly, I think I have something useful that you might want to read about.
That's why I started blogging in the first place, and why I've managed to do it
inconsistently over the last year! So, if you're curious what kind of topics
you'll receive in a newsletter from me, it'll be a wide variety, just like
[my blog](https://jnielson.com/blog). If that's cool with you, I hope you sign
up.

I chatted with [Ryan Warner](https://twitter.com/ryanwarnercodes) and a few
other people in the party corgi discord
([which you should join!](https://www.partycorgi.com/)) about adding newsletters
to personal websites, and learned that not everyone has the same approach I do
to their email inboxes. For over two years now, I've subscribed to the "inbox
zero" lifestyle. I'm pretty sure there hasn't been an entire week pass where
I've left something in my inbox that couldn't be read and taken care of, or
snoozed for later when it was actionable. For the most part, newsletters fall
into the category of "at least skim, but regardless I'll archive it when I get
to the bottom", which has helped me stay up with inbox zero while signing up for
newsletters wherever I can find them. One of the nicest things about newsletters
is their capability to link out to other things, which if I have time and
interest I can click on... but there's nothing that says I have to click!

Looping back to that conversation, a major point that was brought up was being
consistent. I **make no promises** that I'm consistent with sending out my
newsletter. I **will promise** to not send anything "spammy", since I wouldn't
want to get that either (and I'm signed up for my own newsletter).

## Why not post more on your blog?

I'm planning on it! Taking a page out of
[Chris Biscardi's book](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/content-production/),
I'm intending to use my blog as a place to post all sorts of content! If I have
a time-bound newsletter post, it'll probably also end up on my blog. If I end up
doing a
[shadow newsletter...](https://joelhooks.com/shadow-newsletter-for-evergreen-emails-in-convertkit)
which I am not currently doing since it would involve paying for convertkit,
then those shadow posts wouldn't end up on my blog... maybe? I dunno yet. I
personally like newsletters that have a link out to a personal site to read them
on, so maybe it'll end up as a section of my site. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Either way, the blog and newsletter are both priorities for me. The biggest
reason for that, is I enjoy writing! I find writing to be an excellent way to
marshal the thoughts that I have and get them into a communicable way. It also
helps me to get out of my box of 30 people that I work with regularly, which I
think is important enough to put time into.

Anyway, if something that I write about interests you enough to sign up for the
newsletter below, please do! I'm honestly going to be a bit surprised if anyone
reads this post all the way through, so if you do...
