Outline:

- Super useful to find someone you can ask all your questions to if there isn't
  someone assigned
  - Make sure it's okay with them (it usually is since it makes you productive
    so much faster)
- Don't be afraid to clarify processes
- Put up half-finished work to get feedback and make sure you're in line with
  what they typically do
- See if you can setup some regular pair programming (ideally with the same
  person you ask quesitons to)
- Find something you can do during work to connect with people, like foosball!
